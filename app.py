I graduated from Opong Elementary School  and Tagana-an National High School for high school. I‚Äôve always had a passion for playing basketball and online games. Whether I‚Äôm on the court or gaming with friends, I love the challenge and excitement they bring. 
             
Throughout my journey, I‚Äôve worked to balance my studies with my hobbies, constantly striving to improve and enjoy every experience. Both basketball and gaming continue to be big parts of my life, and I look forward to what the future holds.""",
